        <h2>My Hometown</h2>

        <p>
            I was born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mymensingh" target="_blank">Mymensingh, 
            Bangladesh.</a> I grew up in New York City and finally I have settled down in Toronto, ON, 
            Canada. Hmmm… I consider my hometown is <a href="http://toronto.ca" target="_blank">Toronto</a>, but to a lesser extent, 
            Mymensingh as well.
        </p>

        <h2>Life Before RED</h2>

        <p>
            Before I signed up at RED. I was a TTC-Wheel Trans driver where I was transporting people with disabilities from 
            one place to another.
        </p>

        <h2>Secret talent</h2>
        <p>
            Too many to list.  The best of them are:
            <ul>
                <li padding: 30px>Hard working individual</li>
                <li>Over functioning brain</li>
            </ul>
            Add both of them together, I am not less than our beloved Mr. McRobot.
        </p>

        <h2>Life After RED</h2>
        <p>
            After graduating from RED, I wish to work as a full-stack developer in a well know company.  I also wish to work as a 
            freelance developer on my free time.  Finally, I am hoping to continue my studies on IT security courses to become 
            a security analyst and work in that field until I retire.
        </p>

        <h2>Best Travel Experience</h2>

        <p>
            My best travel experience was driving from Toronto to Minneapolis, MN. On my way there, I had visited Windsor, 
            Detroit, Chicago, Madison, and rural part of Wisconsin. The best part was driving through twisted mountain road in
            Wisconsin which has some 50 hairpin like curves going up and down the mountain within 3 miles.  I couldn’t speed more 
            than 30 kph and it was around sunset time.

        <h2>Interesting Fact</h2>

        <p>
            Do you know that <q>handicapped</q> word is a no-no word at the TTC.  It is replaced with <q>people with disability.</q>
